{"name":"AUTO-SBML","tagline":"Basic tool using AUTO & RoadRunner to analyze SBML models","body":"# Auto-SBML\r\nThis project hosts a C++ library (libAuto) as well as C# interfaces and a graphical frontend for analyzing SBML models (using [RoadRunner](http://roadrunner.sf.net) and [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML)). \r\n\r\n## Background \r\nBack in 2009, I first dabbled in ceating a tool for [simplifying bifurcation analysis](http://frank-fbergmann.blogspot.de/2009/02/simplifying-bifurcation-analysis.html). By recompiling a version of [AUTO2000](http://indy.cs.concordia.ca/auto/) by Doedel et.al (the only ever C version of Auto) as library and interfacing it with RoadRunner, it is possible to directly open SBML files and have them run. \r\n\r\n## How to use\r\nThe frontend basically exposes all of AUTO's configuration parameters to be set. Currently it is only possible of finding the unstable regions, it won't perform continuations *yet*. \r\n\r\n![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_LvzJ3dV9uLE/SamPxdkGShI/AAAAAAAAABw/RDlmPgojMho/image%5B4%5D.png?imgmax=800)  \r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the above, all you need to do is to open an SBML model, select the parameter you would like to investigate, select a simulation frame and press run. \r\n\r\nAnother feature I'm rather proud off is that you can simply hold the control key while moving the cursor along the graph and you'll see simulations of the model with the selected parameter altered. A right click will let you sent the model to other SBW modules or save it as SBML model. \r\n\r\n## Using the library\r\nNew in this project is that the core c++ library uses [cmake](http://cmake.org). That hopefully makes it easier to use it across different operating systems. To create the library: \r\n\r\n\tmkdir build\r\n    cmake <location of ./libAuto>\r\n    make\r\n\r\nthis will create `libAuto.dll|dylib|so` for use with the C# interface. Of course you could use the rather basic API as is demonstrated in the [example](./libAuto/example/AutoTestCPP.cpp)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2009-2013, Frank T.
